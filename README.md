Robbo
=====

An accurate reimplementation of classic **Robbo** game in *TypeScript*,
playable in browsers as old as Firefox 28, so suitable even for
smartphones from >= 2014. Supported input devices are: keyboard,
touch screen, game pad. Graphics is rendered on 2D canvas.
Sound effects are produced by emulating POKEY chip.

The original game was created by Janusz Pelc and published by LK Avalon
in 1989 for 8-bit Atari.
